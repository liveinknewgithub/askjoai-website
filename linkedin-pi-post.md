# LinkedIn Post: Claude Code → Pi Switch

**I switched from Claude Code to Pi after months of daily use.**

**Pi is 5x faster. Same model.**

Here's what happened:

My co-founder Pradeep told me to try pi.dev. I was skeptical — Claude Code had been my daily driver for months and I liked it fine.

Then I ran a side-by-side test. Same coding exercise (Next Best Hand in Monopoly Go). Same underlying model.

Pi: 2 minutes.
Claude Code: 10 minutes.

Same prompt. Same model. 5x difference.

What changed? Anthropic's been adding dark magic to Claude Code's system prompt in recent releases. Whatever they're doing to make it "safer" or "more thoughtful" is making it noticeably slower. You can feel it.

Pi just... gets out of the way and lets the model work.

**The other thing that sold me:**

If something is missing in Pi, you tell it — and it builds the extension itself. That's not a feature. That's a philosophy. The tool extends itself.

**The one thing I miss:**

Claude Code's status line. That's it. That's the list.

If you're a founder or developer using Claude Code and it's been feeling sluggish lately — it's not your imagination. Try pi.dev for a week. You won't go back.
