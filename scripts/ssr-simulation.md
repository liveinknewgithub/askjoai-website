## Recommendations

### Messaging Optimizations

1. **Lead with privacy proof, not claims** - The "verifiable architecture" section drives conversions. Consider moving higher on page.

2. **Address hardware concern early** - 16GB requirement filters out ~15% of potential users. Consider clearer system check or "check compatibility" CTA.

3. **Add more social proof from specific professions** - Consultants, lawyers, researchers rated highest. Targeted testimonials could boost conversions.

4. **Quantify time savings** - "Save X hours/week" messaging would resonate with high-intent users.

### Target Audience Refinement

**Primary target (highest intent):**
- Knowledge workers 35-55
- Income $100k+
- Heavy Notes/Mail/Photos users
- Privacy-conscious

**Secondary target:**
- Creative professionals
- Academic researchers
- Healthcare workers (HIPAA concern)

**Deprioritize:**
- Students / entry-level (hardware + data barriers)
- Non-Mac users (obvious)
- Users with <5 years of digital history
