# Twitter/X Thread: Claude Code → Pi Switch

## Tweet 1 (hook)

I switched from Claude Code to pi.dev last week.

Same model. 5x faster.

Here's the receipts 🧵

## Tweet 2

Ran the same coding exercise side by side (Next Best Hand in Monopoly Go).

Pi: 2 minutes
Claude Code: 10 minutes

Same prompt. Same Opus 4.6. Not even close.

What happened to Claude Code?

Anthropic's been adding dark magic to the system prompt in recent releases. Whatever they're doing is making it noticeably slower.

Pi just lets the model cook.

The wildest thing about Pi:

If a feature is missing, you tell it — and it builds the extension itself.

The tool literally extends itself.

## Tweet 5

The one thing I miss about Claude Code:

The status line.

That's the whole list.

## Tweet 6

If Claude Code has been feeling sluggish lately — it's not your imagination.

Try pi.dev for a week.
